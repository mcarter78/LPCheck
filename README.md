# LPCheck

A simple tool for when I am record shopping.  The app fetches my record collection from Discogs.com API and I can enter an
artist name or album title of a record to see if I own it already.

#Technologies Used

React, Redux, Express, Bootstrap, Discogs API, ES6, SASS

# Future improvements

I would like to continue development by implementing Discogs OAuth so anyone can load up their own collection and use the app.
I would also like to develop for mobile devices, using the camera to scan barcodes to check records.
